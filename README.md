These are the tools I use offline. 

HTML file and .scpt file

Hope you find some of this code handy!  

Copy_to_icloud.scpt : this is a droplet that allows you to directly copy that dropped file to icloud.  Using Terminal to do so. 

And this is a second_repository that I have not shared to not confuse people that are shared the first repository.
